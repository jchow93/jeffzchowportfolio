# Hero Section Variations

Here are different options for your hero section introduction. Pick the one that feels most authentic to you!

## Option 1: Builder/Creator/Craft (Current - Like mprogano)

**Greeting:**
"Hello 👋 I'm Jeff, a product manager who builds, captures, and creates—both in code and in life."

**Three Pillars:**
- **Builder**: I design and ship products that turn complex systems into tools people actually use
- **Creator**: When I'm not building products, I'm producing music, capturing moments through photography and video, and finding flow in the kitchen and the gym
- **Craft**: I care about the details—whether it's a product that creates measurable impact or a beat that hits just right

---

## Option 2: Simple & Direct (Like pratibhajoshi)

**Greeting:**
"I'm Jeff, a Product Manager who builds products that create measurable impact. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple solutions, both in product and in life."

**Tagline:**
"When I'm not shipping products, you'll find me producing music, shooting photos, cooking, or on the basketball court."

---

## Option 3: Multi-Passion (Like glorialo)

**Greeting:**
"I build products, produce music, capture moments, and create experiences."

**Description:**
"I'm a product manager based in [your location] with experience building AI products, enterprise software, and consumer platforms. When I'm not shipping products, I'm producing beats, shooting photos and videos, cooking, or finding flow in the gym and on the court."

## Option 4: Story-Driven

**Greeting:**
"Hello 👋 I'm Jeff"

**Introduction:**
"a product manager with an engineer's mind and a creator's heart. I build products that turn complex systems into tools people actually use, and when I'm not shipping features, I'm producing music, capturing moments, or finding my flow—whether that's in the kitchen, the gym, or on the court."

**Three Pillars:**
- **Product**: Building AI-powered platforms and enterprise automation
- **Creative**: Music production, photography, videography
- **Flow**: Cooking, basketball, lifting

---

## Option 5: Minimal & Bold

**Greeting:**
"I build products, produce beats, and capture moments."

**Description:**
"Product Manager by day. Music producer, photographer, and creator by night. I turn complex problems into simple solutions—whether that's shipping a product that generates $340K+ in revenue or crafting a beat that hits just right."

---

## Option 6: Problem-Solver Focus

**Greeting:**
"Hello 👋 I'm Jeff"

**Introduction:**
"a product manager who solves problems—both in code and in life. I build products that create measurable impact, and when I'm not shipping features, I'm producing music, shooting photos, cooking, or finding flow in the gym and on the court."

**Three Pillars:**
- **Product**: Turning complex systems into tools people actually use
- **Creative**: Music production, photography, videography
- **Flow**: Cooking, basketball, lifting

## My Recommendation: Option 1 (Current)

I went with Option 1 because:
- ✅ Shows personality without being too casual
- ✅ Naturally incorporates your hobbies
- ✅ Professional but human
- ✅ Matches mprogano's style (which you liked)
- ✅ Three pillars structure is memorable

## Customization Tips

### Make it more casual:
- "Hey, I'm Jeff" instead of "Hello 👋 I'm Jeff"
- More conversational language

### Make it more professional:
- Remove hobbies, focus on product
- More formal language

- Lead with creative passions
- "I'm a music producer who also builds products"
